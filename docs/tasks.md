# KafkaRedditFlow Improvement Tasks

This document contains a prioritized list of tasks to improve the KafkaRedditFlow project. Each task is marked with a checkbox that can be checked off when completed.

## Code Organization and Structure

1. [ ] Refactor the `produce_messages` function in `main.py` to fix the issue where the producer is closed inside the loop, preventing subsequent iterations from working properly
2. [ ] Create a proper Python package structure with setup.py or pyproject.toml for better dependency management
3. [ ] Implement a configuration module to centralize all configuration parameters
4. [ ] Add type hints consistently across all modules
5. [ ] Standardize naming conventions across the codebase
6. [ ] Extract hardcoded values into constants or configuration files
7. [ ] Implement a proper logging strategy with configurable log levels and formats

## Error Handling and Resilience

8. [ ] Implement proper exception handling in the `produce_messages` function
9. [ ] Add retry mechanisms for Reddit API calls with exponential backoff
10. [ ] Implement circuit breakers for external service calls
11. [ ] Add health checks for the Kafka connection
12. [ ] Create a graceful shutdown mechanism for the application
13. [ ] Implement proper error reporting and monitoring
14. [ ] Add dead-letter queues for failed messages

## Testing

15. [ ] Create unit tests for all modules
16. [ ] Implement integration tests for the Kafka producer
17. [ ] Add end-to-end tests for the entire pipeline
18. [ ] Set up a CI/CD pipeline for automated testing
19. [ ] Implement test coverage reporting
20. [ ] Add performance tests for the Kafka producer
21. [ ] Create mocks for external dependencies in tests

## Security

22. [ ] Review and restrict IAM permissions in `kafka_policy_template.json` to follow the principle of least privilege
23. [ ] Implement secure credential management beyond environment variables
24. [ ] Add input validation for all user inputs
25. [ ] Implement proper authentication for the Kafka producer (currently using SSL but code uses SASL)
26. [ ] Review and fix security settings in the MSK cluster configuration
27. [ ] Implement proper secrets management for API credentials
28. [ ] Add security scanning to the CI/CD pipeline

## Performance and Scalability

29. [ ] Optimize the Reddit API client to reduce API calls
30. [ ] Implement batching for Kafka message production
31. [ ] Add metrics collection for performance monitoring
32. [ ] Implement backpressure handling for the Kafka producer
33. [ ] Optimize the Kafka producer configuration for better throughput
34. [ ] Implement partitioning strategy for the Kafka topic
35. [ ] Add caching for frequently accessed data

## Documentation

36. [ ] Create comprehensive README.md with project overview, setup instructions, and usage examples
37. [ ] Update MSK_SETUP.md with specific Kafka version and IAM authentication details
38. [ ] Add API documentation for all modules
39. [ ] Create architecture diagrams for the system
40. [ ] Document the data flow from Reddit to Kafka to Iceberg
41. [ ] Add troubleshooting guide for common issues
42. [ ] Create developer onboarding documentation

## Infrastructure as Code

43. [ ] Modularize Terraform configurations for better reusability
44. [ ] Add Terraform validation in CI/CD pipeline
45. [ ] Implement infrastructure testing with Terratest
46. [ ] Add proper tagging strategy for AWS resources
47. [ ] Implement state locking for Terraform
48. [ ] Create separate environments (dev, staging, prod) in Terraform
49. [ ] Optimize AWS resource configurations for cost efficiency

## Monitoring and Observability

50. [ ] Enable CloudWatch logging for the MSK cluster
51. [ ] Implement application metrics using Prometheus
52. [ ] Create dashboards for monitoring the application
53. [ ] Set up alerts for critical issues
54. [ ] Implement distributed tracing
55. [ ] Add log aggregation and analysis
56. [ ] Create runbooks for operational tasks

## Data Quality and Governance

57. [ ] Implement schema validation for Reddit posts
58. [ ] Add data quality checks for the pipeline
59. [ ] Implement data lineage tracking
60. [ ] Create data retention policies
61. [ ] Implement data masking for sensitive information
62. [ ] Add data cataloging for better discoverability
63. [ ] Create data documentation for the Iceberg tables
